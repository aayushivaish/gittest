This is a repo used for showing how to use Git.  We will all make commits, pulls, pushed, checkouts, branches, etc, and we will deal with merge conflicts and look at git histories.


In the activity today, we are going to work together to write a program...

In the file src/classprogram.py, we are going to create some variables and perform some manipulations to make a program that will do something....


Students 1-8:
In each of your fields, you are going to create a variable and give it a value.  

Students 1-5: create the variable name<N> (N is your number... 1-4) and set it to your name

Students 6-10: Add an element to the list "mylist". The value can be any numeric value (doesn't matter what number you choose). 

Students 11-15: Create a string that will say "Student <N> <insert verb> the number <number>".  <N> is your number, minus 10.  <insert verb> means adlib and pick a verb. <number> should be the Nth number in the list "mylist".  Call your string variable "message<N>"  (<N> is the same number as before).

Students 16-20: Print message<N>.  <N> is your number, minus 15.
